> *LNN (Liquid Neural Network) is a recurrent neural network which is very unlike the traditional neural networks that work on processing inputs in a fixed manner.  
> LNNs use differential equations to update each neuron's state over time, making them more dynamic and adaptive with changes — similar to how liquid adapts to the shape of its container.  
> This ability allows them to respond flexibly to changing inputs and environments with fewer parameters while remaining interpretable.  
> LNNs are particularly powerful for tasks involving temporal or sequential data, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and time-series prediction, where adaptability in real time is crucial.*
